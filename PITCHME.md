# Let's talk about React!

## What is React?

1. Library (not a "framework")
2. Declarative
3. Component based 
4. ??
5. Profit ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘!

## Did Steve Tell You That?!

Yep, back in about 2014, he did, and turned out he was right!

## &lt;Hello name="World">

```
const Hello = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
```

```
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

At its purest, React Components are simple transformation functions which take input and spit out HTML.

---
## Composition!

```
const App = (props) => {
  return <div>
    <Hello name={props.names[0]}/>
    <Hello name="Hal"/>
    <Hello name="Dave"/>
  </div>
}
```

---
## Don't call it HTML!

#### Please, it's JSX

```
const Hello = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
```

```
var Hello = function Hello(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    "h1",
    null,
    "Hello ",
    props.name
  );
};
```
