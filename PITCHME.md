# Let's talk about React!

---
## What is React?

1. Library (not a "framework")
2. Declarative
3. Component based 
4. Technology agnostic
5. Profit ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘!

## Oh no, not another frontend thing!

## React is different, it's gonna be great!*

## Did Steve Tell You That?!

Yep, back in about 2014, he did, and turned out he was right!

---
## &lt;Hello name="World">

```
const Hello = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
```

```
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

At its purest, React Components are simple transformation functions which take input and return HTML.

---
## Composition!

```
const AppComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>
    <Hello name={props.names[0]}/>
    <Hello name="Hal"/>
    <Hello name="Dave"/>
  </div>
}
```

---
## Don't call it HTML!

#### Please, it's JSX

```
const Hello = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
```

```
var Hello = function Hello(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    "h1",
    null,
    "Hello ",
    props.name
  );
};
```

JSX is a simple way to express UI. It is an expression, which allows a programmer to do interesting things. It is not a template, and is not defined in its own file.

## React Lifecycle

Mounting > Updating > Unmounting

* componentWillMount
* render
* componentDidMount
* componentWillReceiveProps
* shouldComponentUpdate
* componentWillUpdate
* componentDidUpdate
* componentWillUnmount

---
## Components can have State

* setState
* forceUpdate

---
## Developer Experience

```
  render () {
    let charts = this.charts.map((chart, idx) =>
      <Chart
        //key={idx}
        type={chart.type}
        ...
      />
    )

    return <div className="charts">{charts}</div>
  }
```

## But does it work with Typescript?

---
## React Component Vs Angular Component

```
const Hello = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
```

```
let helloWorldTemplate = '<h1>Hello, {$ctrl.name}</h1>'

angular.component('HelloWorld', {
  bindings: {
    name: '='    
  },
  templateUrl: helloWorldTemplate,
})
```

---
## Salient Differences

1. React does not use templates
2. React does not use watchers or two way binding
3. React's lifecycle is explicitly defined
4. React is WYSIWYG

---
## How Might a Transition Work?

1. Remember, my Module talk and my Component doc?
1. Imagine the UI is a tree of nodes, where each node is a Component
1. Start out at the leaf nodes of the application
1. Replace Angular Components with React Components defined in JS Modules!
1. Work your way up

(See what I did there?)

---
## Angular + React??

Lots of these wrappers exist:

```
// Our React component
import { HelloWorld } from './hello'
// Our Angular << React wrapper
import { react2angular } from 'react2angular'

angular
  .module('looker.silly.components', [])
  .component('HelloWorld', react2angular(HelloWorld, []))
```

---
## Some Projects Already Use React!

Workbooks
Adam's Mobile apps (yep, React Native give yous mobile support)

---
## Advanced Land

* High order functions to replace Transclusion
* Good tooling support
* Testing is good
* Backend rendering

---
## Why you should not use React

![pop](/img/popularity.png)

---
## Why you should use React

* Well supported
* Simple API
* Does one thing well
* Makes it easy to reason about your UI

---
## Applause

- Not really: https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v0.3.0 -
- Projects that already used react
- Simple API
- Simple Representation of a UI Component
- Functional
- Working with Typescript
- Working with Angular
- Within Modules
- Everything is a function
- Bye transclusion (remember everything is a function)
